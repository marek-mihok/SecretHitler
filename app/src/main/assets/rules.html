  <i>
    The year is 1932. The place is pre-WWII Germany.
    In Secret Hitler, players are German politicians
    attempting to hold a fragile Liberal government
    together and stem the rising tide of Fascism.
    Watch out though—there are secret Fascists among
    you, and one player is Secret Hitler.
  </i>


  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the game, each player
    is secretly assigned to one of three roles:
    <b>Liberal</b>, <b>Fascist</b>, or <b>Hitler</b>. The Liberals have
    a majority, but they don’t know for sure who
    anyone is; Fascists must resort to secrecy and
    sabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays
    for the Fascist team, and the Fascists know
    Hitler’s identity from the outset, but Hitler
    doesn’t know the Fascists and must work to
    figure them out.
  </p>

  <p><b>
      The Liberals win by enacting five Liberal
      Policies or killing Hitler. The Fascists win by
      enacting six Fascist Policies, or if Hitler is
      elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies
      have been enacted.
    </b></p>

  <p>
    Whenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the
    government becomes more powerful, and the
    President is granted a single-use power which
    must be used before the next round can begin. It
    doesn’t matter what team the President is on; in
    fact, even Liberal players might be tempted to
    enact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers.
  </p>


  <h1>OBJECT</h1>

  <p>
    Every player has a secret identity as a member
    of either the Liberal team or the Fascist team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Players on the Liberal team win if either:
  <ul>
    <li>Five Liberal Policies are enacted.</li>
    <i>OR</i>
    <li>Hitler is assassinated.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Players on the Fascist team win if either:
  <ul>
    <li>Six Fascist Policies are enacted.</li>
    <i>OR</i>
    <li>Hitler is elected Chancellor any time after
      the third Fascist Policy has been enacted.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>


  <h1>POLICY CARDS</h1>

  <p>
    Deck consists of <b>17</b> policy cards.
  <ul>
    <li><b>6</b> Liberal</li>
    <li><b>11</b> Fascist</li>
  </ul>
  </p>


  <h1>SET UP</h1>

  <h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>

  <p>
    Secret Hitler is played in rounds.
    Each round has an <b>Election</b> to form a government,
    a <b>Legislative Session</b> to enact a new Policy,
    and an <b>Executive Action</b> to exercise governmental power.
  </p>

  <p class="redText"><b>Tip:</b> Notice eye icon on top right. Screens with striketrough eye
    icon is private otherwise content of screen should be shared with all players.</p>

  <h2>ELECTION</h2>

  <h3>1. Pass the Presidential Candidacy</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of a new round, the President
    function is transferred the next player, who
    is the new Presidential Candidate.</p>

  <h3>2. Nominate a Chancellor</h3>
  <p>The Presidential Candidate chooses a Chancellor Candidate
    within any other eligible player. The Presidential
    Candidate is free to discuss Chancellor options
    with the table to build consensus and make it
    more likely the Government gets elected.</p>

  <h3>Eligibility:</h3>
  <p>The last elected President and Chancellor are
    “term-limited,” and ineligible to be nominated
    as Chancellor Candidate.</p>

  <div class="redText">
    ON ELIGIBILITY:
    <i>
      <ul>
        <li>Term limits apply to the President and
          Chancellor who were last elected, not to the
          last pair nominated.</li><br>
        <li>Term limits only affect nominations to the
          Chancellorship; anyone can be President, even
          someone who was just Chancellor.</li><br>
        <li>If there are only five players left in the
          game, only the last elected Chancellor is
          ineligible to be Chancellor Candidate; the
          last President may be nominated.</li><br>
        <li>There are some other rules that affect
          eligibility in specific ways: the Veto Power
          and the Election Tracker. You don’t need to
          worry about those yet, and we’ll talk about
          each one in its relevant section.</li>
      </ul>
    </i>

    <b>Tip:</b> App will handle eligibility of players.
    President candidate will be able to naminate only eligible players.
  </div>

  <h3>3. Vote on the government</h3>
  <p>Once the Presidential Candidate has chosen an
    eligible Chancellor Candidate, players may
    discuss the proposed government until everyone
    is ready to vote. Every player, including the
    Candidates, votes on the proposed government.</p>

  <p><b>If the vote is a tie, or if a majority of
      players votes no:</b></p>

  <p>The vote fails. The Presidential Candidate
    misses this chance to be elected, and the
    President function moves to the next
    player. The Election Tracker is advanced by
    one Election.</p>

  <p><b>Election Tracker:</b> If the group rejects three
    governments in a row, the country is thrown into
    chaos. Immediately reveal the Policy on top of
    the Policy deck and enact it. Any power granted
    by this Policy is ignored, but the Election
    Tracker resets, and existing term-limits are
    forgotten. All players become eligible to hold
    the office of Chancellor for the next Election.
    If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in
    the Policy deck at this point, shuffle them with
    the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck.</p>

  <p><i>Any time a new Policy tile is played face-up,
      the Election Tracker is reset, whether it was
      enacted by an elected government or enacted by
      the frustrated populace.</i></p>

  <p><b>If a majority of players votes yes:</b></p>

  <p>The Presidential Candidate and Chancellor
    Candidate become the new President and
    Chancellor, respectively.</p>

  <ul>
    <b>➤ If three or more Fascist Policies have been
      enacted already:</b><br><br>
    <i>Ask if the new Chancellor is Hitler. If
      so, the game is over and the Fascists win.
      Otherwise, other players know for sure the
      Chancellor is not Hitler.
    </i>
  </ul>

  <p>Proceed as usual to the Legislative Session.</p>


  <h2>LEGISLATIVE SESSION</h2>

  <p>
    During the Legislative Session, the President
    and Chancellor work together to enact a new
    Policy in secret. The President draws the top
    three tiles from the Policy deck, looks at them
    in secret, and discards one tile face down into
    the Discard pile. The remaining two tiles go to
    the Chancellor, who looks in secret, discards
    one Policy tile face down, and enacts the
    remaining Policy by placing the tile face up on
    the corresponding track.
  </p>

  <p>
    Verbal and nonverbal communication between the
    President and Chancellor is forbidden. The
    President and Chancellor MAY NOT pick Policies
    to play at random, shuffle the tiles before
    discarding one, or do anything else clever to
    avoid secretly and intentionally selecting a
    Policy. Additionally, the President should hand
    both Policies over at the same time, rather
    than one at a time to gauge the Chancellor’s
    reaction. Attempting to telegraph the contents
    of your hand using randomness or any other
    unusual selection procedure violates the spirit
    of the game. Don’t do it.
  </p>

  <p><b>Discarded Policy tiles should never be revealed
      to the group. Players must rely on the word of
      the President and Chancellor, who are free to
      lie.</b></p>

  <p class="redText">
    <b>ABOUT LYING:</b> Often, some players learn
    things that the rest of the players
    don’t know, like when the President and
    Chancellor get to see Policy tiles, or
    when a President uses the Investigate
    power to see someone’s Party Membership
    card. You can always lie about hidden
    knowledge in Secret Hitler. The only time
    players MUST tell the truth is in game-
    ending, Hitler-related scenarios: a player
    who is Hitler must say so if assassinated
    or if elected Chancellor after three
    Fascist Policies have been enacted.
  </p>

  <p><b>If there are fewer than three tiles remaining
      in the Policy deck at the end of a Legislative
      Session,</b> shuffle them with the Discard pile to
    create a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles
    should never be revealed, and they should not be
    simply placed on top of the new Policy deck.</p>

  <p><b>If the government enacted a Fascist Policy that
      covered up a Presidential Power,</b> the sitting
    President gets to use that power. Proceed to the
    Executive Action.</p>

  <p><b>If the government enacted a Liberal Policy or
      a Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential
      Power,</b> begin a new round with a new Election.</p>

  <h2>EXECUTIVE ACTION</h2>
  <p>If the newly-enacted Fascist Policy grants a
    Presidential Power, the President must use it
    before the next round can begin. Before using
    a power, the President is free to discuss the
    issue with other players, but ultimately the
    President gets to decide how and when the power
    is used. Gameplay cannot continue until the
    President uses the power. Presidential Powers
    are used only once; they don’t stack or roll
    over to future turns.</p>

  <h2>PRESIDENTIAL POWERS</h2>
  <h3>Investigate Loyalty</h3>
  <p>The President chooses a player to
    investigate their party membership. The President
    may share (or lie about!) the
    results of their investigation at
    their discretion. No player may be
    investigated twice in the same game.
  </p>

  <h3>Call Special Election</h3>
  <p>The President chooses any other
    player at the table to be the next
    Presidential Candidate.
    Any player can become President—even
    players that are term-limited. The
    new President nominates an eligible
    player as Chancellor Candidate and
    the Election proceeds as usual.</p>

  <p><b>A Special Election does not skip any
      players. After a Special Election,
      the President function returns to the
      player next to the President who enacted the
      Special Election.</b></p>

  <p>If the President passes the
    presidency to the next player in the
    rotation, that player would get to
    run for President twice in a row:
    once for the Special Election and
    once for their normal shift in the
    Presidential rotation.</p>

  <h3>Policy Peek</h3>
  <p>The President secretly looks at the
    top three tiles in the Policy deck.</p>

  <h3>Execution</h3>
  <p>The President executes one player
    at the table. If that
    player is Hitler, the game ends in
    a Liberal victory. If the executed
    player is not Hitler, the table
    should <b>not</b> learn whether a Fascist or
    a Liberal has been killed; players
    must try to work out for themselves
    the new table balance. Executed
    players are removed from the game and
    may not speak, vote, or run
    for office.</p>

  <h2>VETO POWER</h2>
  <p>The Veto Power is a special rule that comes into
    effect after five Fascist Policies have been
    enacted. For all Legislative Sessions after the
    fifth Fascist Policy is enacted, the Executive
    branch gains a permanent new ability to discard
    all three Policy tiles if <b>both</b> the Chancellor
    and President agree.</p>

  <p>The President draws three Policy tiles,
    discards one, and passes the remaining two to
    the Chancellor as usual. Then Chancellor may,
    instead of enacting either Policy, say “I wish
    to veto this agenda.” If the President consents
    by saying, “I agree to the veto,” both Policies
    are discarded and the President placard passes
    to the left as usual. If the President does not
    consent, the Chancellor must enact a Policy
    as normal.</p>

  <p>Each use of the Veto Power represents an
    inactive government and advances the Election
    Tracker by one.</p>


  <h1>STRATEGY NOTES</h1>
  <p><b>• Everyone should claim to be a Liberal.</b> Since
    the Liberal team has a voting majority, it can
    easily shut out any player claiming to be a
    Fascist. As a Fascist, there is no advantage to
    outing yourself to the majority. Additionally,
    Liberals should usually tell the truth. Liberals
    are trying to figure out the game like a puzzle,
    so lying can put their team at a
    significant disadvantage.
  </p>

  <p><b>• If this is your first time playing Hitler,
      just remember: be as Liberal as possible.</b> Enact
    Liberal Policies. Vote for Liberal governments.
    Kiss babies. Trust your fellow Fascists to
    create opportunities for you to enact Liberal
    Policies and to advance Fascism on their turns.
    The Fascists win by subtly manipulating the
    table and waiting for the right cover to enact
    Fascist Policies, not by overtly playing
    as evil.
  </p>

  <p><b>• Liberals frequently benefit from slowing play
      down and discussing the available information.</b>
    Fascists frequently benefit from rushing votes
    and creating confusion.
  </p>

  <p><b>• Fascists most often win by electing Hitler,
      not by enacting six Policies!</b> Electing Hitler
    isn’t an optional or secondary win condition,
    it’s the core of a successful Fascist strategy.
    Hitler should always play as a Liberal, and
    should generally avoid lying or getting into
    fights and disagreements with other players.
    When the time comes, Hitler needs the Liberals’
    trust to get elected. Even if Hitler isn’t
    ultimately elected, the distrust sown among
    Liberals is key to getting Fascists elected late
    in the game.
  </p>

  <p><b>• Ask other players to explain why they took
      an action.</b> This is especially important with
    Presidential Powers—in fact, ask ahead of time
    whom a candidate is thinking of investigating/
    appointing/assassinating.
  </p>

  <p><b>• If a Fascist Policy comes up, there are only
      three possible culprits: The President, the
      Chancellor, or the Policy Deck.</b> Try to figure
    out who (or what!) put you in this position.</p>
